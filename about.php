                <h1>Our Story</h1>
                <p>
                    Ugandaâ€™s  environment is deteriorating due to chronic pollution and the rapid destruction of natural resources. If not addressed, our country will waste away, and this is why TUKUUMA was conceived in March 2019 to provide sustainable ways of waste management.
                </p>
                <p>
                    TUKUUMA is a youth founded and led non-profit, volunteer based organisation committed to providing lasting solutions for the current environmental challenges of communities in Uganda and Africa.
                </p>  
                <p>   
                    What began with volunteering out of office time to make a positive difference in the environment of communities in Mukono District, is now a fully fledged, committed organisation that cares, nurtures and protects the environment.
